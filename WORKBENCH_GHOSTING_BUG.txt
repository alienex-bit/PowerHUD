KNOWN ISSUE - Workbench Ghosting
=================================
Date: 2026-02-10
Status: ON HOLD

Description:
- Spacers work correctly in-game (render as blank space)
- Spacers show correctly in workbench button list
- BUT: In workbench preview, ghost/faded text appears where spacer should be
- Ghost shows the element that was clicked to add the spacer below it

Root Cause:
- DrawContext retains previous render when init() is called
- Happens specifically when adding spacers (+ button)
- Does NOT happen with UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT buttons

Attempted Fixes:
1. Added isInitializing flag - didn't work
2. Added skipNextRender flag - didn't work
3. Tried matrix push/pop/loadIdentity - didn't work

Next Steps to Try:
- Force a complete screen refresh/rebuild
- Use a separate DrawContext for HUD preview
- Add a delay before rendering after init()
- Clear the entire framebuffer before rendering

Workaround:
- Just ignore the ghost in preview
- Test actual HUD in-game to verify layout
