Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of this project seriously. If you find a vulnerability, please do not open a public Issue. Instead, follow these steps:

    Private Disclosure: Send a detailed description of the vulnerability to me privately. (If you have my Discord or Email, use that; otherwise, use GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting feature if enabled).

    Details to Include:

        The specific class or logic affected (e.g., PowerHudConfig.java).

        A clear set of steps to reproduce the issue.

        If possible, a suggestion for a fix that maintains our Immutable Baseline and GSON Static Inner Class structure.

Our Process

    Acknowledgement: I will acknowledge your report as soon as I review it with my AI assistant.

    Resolution: Once a fix is verified using my Unified Execution Script, a new version will be pushed to the repository.

    Credits: If you'd like, I will credit you for the discovery in the release notes.
